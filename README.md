# A-star
A* algorithm is a best-first search algorithm in which the cost associated with a node is the cost of the path from a start node to the node in question and the cost of the path from that node to a goal node (heuristic estimate).

Goal was to implement it using a minimum binary heap and for it to support 'hinders'.
